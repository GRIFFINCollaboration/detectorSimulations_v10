Lines beginning with either a 'W' or a '#' are comments

Lines beginning with a 'P' are a header which describes a level of the  
nucleus.  The first number is the excitation energy in keV, the second is the  
half life in seconds
Indented lines under the 'P' lines are decay modes for that  
excitation.  There are two type of records here, distinguished by the  
number of columns.

If there are 3 columns only, this is a header which describes all  
decays of that type from this level.
The first column is the decay mode, the second column is zero, and the  
third column in the branching ratio to this mode, as a fraction of  
unity.  Therefore, the third columns of all the 3-column records under  
a given 'P' line should sum to 1.0.

If there are four columns, this is a record which describes a subset  
of the decay type, specific to a given lower level in the daughter  
species.  The first column is the decay type, the second column is the  
excitation level of the daughter (in keV), and the third column is the  
branching ratio as a percentage (! note... not a fraction of unity) of  
the total branching ratio which came from the 3-column record for this  
decay.
