After a successful make, you can run the simulation in one of 3 ways:
A macro file to run in batch mode (spice.mac for exmaple), a visual run with altvis.mac, or a bash script 
for several runs with one command etc.

A non-visual SPICE batch run will produce a g4out.root ROOT file containing chosen histograms and a kin.dat kinematics data file.
These can then be moved to wherever in a script for example.
A visual run can also be ran in batch to produce a HepRep visualisation file used for when the detector needs to be 
visualised (not often), but mostly in the OGL viewer ran using ./Griffinv10 command and some subsequent inputs for just the chamber.

There are 3 parts to the target system: A backer that is furthest from the detector rings (furthest downstream), the target 
itself that is in the middle, and finally the protector that is the first point-of-impact for the beam
and is the nearest part to the detetor rings (furthest upstream).
Each part of the target system, if used, must have a material, a surface density (with units) and a thickness (with units)
fully defined in the macro. Materials that are not defined correctly will seg-fault the program.
Once this is so, it is work checking the targets have been placed correctly in the simulation. A correct position will be determined 
by the initial beam position. It is also worth checking the beam distribution chosen sits where you want it to 
(e.g. uniform through the target) which can be done with the visualisation macro also.

The field file must match with the geometry used to create the chamber. These are two separate lines in the macro that can be easily overlooked but will invalidate your results.

You can feed a beam distribution through a SPICE target into the simulation via the
"/Detsys/gun/FileDistro 1" command. It reads a file specified by the target material
e.g. Calcium.dat, or Gold.dat from within the build folder.
The beam file contains 2 columns - the first is the z-position value of the beam, and
the second is the weighted probability of emission from that position. The probabilities 
do not have to sum to 1.

Occasionally the program enters a geometric error loop. It will exit. 

The macro for both the batch run (spice.mac), and the visualisation run
have line-by-line comments.
