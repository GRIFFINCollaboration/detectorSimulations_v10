ALWAYS CHECK
SPICE construction options, field settings and target/gun positions.
These are three separate lines in all macros, that can be easily overlooked.
They must match.
Print statements in the program will confirm the location the target/gun should be for the selected SPICE options.


After a successful compilation, you can run the simulation in one the following ways:

1) Macro mode
./Griffinv10 spice.mac
Execute a single macro file in batch mode.
The detailed comments in spice.mac explain the various functions
Run " root -l NewSpiceSort.C" to sort the default g4out.root to a histogram file 

2) Source distributions
The file IonSPICE.mac gives an example of using the radioactive decay package instead of an electron gun.
As a quick alternative to the radioactive ions shown in IonSPICE.mac 
You can edit AutoSource.sh to manually define a distribution of electron energies
"bash AutoSource.sh" will sort and sum the output histogram files to a single spectrum

3) Visualisation mode
./Griffinv10
This will Open the GUI interface and execute vis.mac
You may then run the following command in the "Session" box to open the SPICE visualisation
/control/execute SPICE_vis.mac
You may choose option in SPICE_vis.mac before running.
Also after running the script addition commands from the script may be run in the "Session" box e.g. 
/DetSys/gun/efficiencyEnergy 800 keV
/run/beamOn 2 ### Keep number low
You can disable parts of the geometry in the gui "Scene tree" for clearer viewing

4) Automated efficiency curve batch mode 
bash AutoEffCurve.sh
To automatically generate an efficiency curve.
First edit AutoEffCurve.sh to select energy points, lens, target and event number.
Run 'bash AutoEffCurve.sh' to run geant4 and generate sequential root files and efficiency points
This is very rough and proper fitting should be done for detailed work

TARGETS:
Multi-layered targets may be added as described in spice.mac
These stack face to face from the beam position defined by /DetSys/gun/position
(at the time the target layer command is called)
Materials that are not defined within the MyMaterial framework within
DetectorConstructionSuppressed.cc will seg-fault the program.
You can use the visualiser to ensure the targets are positioned as expected

DISTRIBUTION:
You may wish to distribute emission along the (z) beam axis according
to some non-uniform reaction distribution
Used "/DetSys/gun/FileDistro data.dat" where data.dat is any plain text file
containing white space delimited position and probability weight.
Position should be in um and relative to /DetSys/gun/position 
Weight does not need to be normalised.

Occasionally the program enters a geometric error loop.
This is not critical and should pass.
