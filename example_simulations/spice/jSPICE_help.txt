ALWAYS CHECK
SPICE construction options, field settings and target/gun positions.
These are three separate lines in all macros, that can be easily overlooked.
They must match.
Print statements in the program will confirm the location the target/gun should be for the selected SPICE options.


After a successful compilation, you can run the simulation in one the following ways:

1) Macro mode
./Griffinv10 spice.mac
Execute a single macro file in bath mode.
The detailed comments in spice.mac explain the various functions
The file IonSPICE.mac gives an example of using the radioactive decay package instead of an electron gun

2) Visualisation mode
./Griffinv10
This will Open the GUI interface and execute vis.mac
You may then run the following command in the "Session" box to open the SPICE visualisation
/control/execute SPICE_vis.mac
You may choose option in SPICE_vis.mac before running.
Also after running the script addition commands from the script may be run in the "Session" box e.g. 
/DetSys/gun/efficiencyEnergy 800 keV
/run/beamOn 2 ### Keep number low
You can disable parts of the geometry in the gui "Scene tree" for clearer viewing

3) Automated efficiency curve batch mode 
bash AutoEffCurve.sh
To automatically generate an efficiency curve.
First edit AutoEffCurve.sh to select energy points, lens, target and event number.
Run 'bash AutoEffCurve.sh' to run geant4 and generate sequential root files,
then run 'root MakeEfficiency.c' in the same folder as the previous output
to generate and save the efficiency curve.
If you have jRootAnalysisTools installed you can instead run MakeEfficiencyjRoot.c,
which will use fits to provide more accurate results.

4) Automated limits batch mode 
After producing root files with AutoEffCurve.sh you can run
root MakeLimits.c
This will calculate segment by segment efficiency limits useful for sorting data.
It is recommended to use additional points in AutoEffCurve.sh as the individual pixel
efficiency curves have far sharper features than the whole detector.

5) Automated spectrum batch mode 
As a quick alternative to the radioactive ions shown in IonSPICE.mac 
You can edit AutoSource.sh to manually define an distribution of electron energies
"bash AutoSource.sh" will sort and sum the output histogram files to a single spectrum


TARGETS:
Multi-layered targets may be added as described in spice.mac
These stack face to face from the beam position defined by /DetSys/gun/position
(at the time the target layer command is called)
Materials that are not defined within the MyMaterial framework within
DetectorConstructionSuppressed.cc will seg-fault the program.
You can use the visualiser to ensure the targets are positioned as expected

HISTOGRAMS:
Histograms are produced for SPICE showing the:
Detected Energies
Emission angle of detected electrons (for kinematic work)
The emission position (to check the distribution settings, z is relative to /DetSys/gun/position)

DISTRIBUTION:
You may wish to distribute emission along the (z) beam axis according
to some non-uniform reaction distribution
Used "/Detsys/gun/FileDistro data.dat" where data.dat is any plain text file
containing white space delimited position and probability weight.
Position should be in um and relative to /DetSys/gun/position 
Weight does not need to be normalised.

Occasionally the program enters a geometric error loop.
This is not critical and should pass.
