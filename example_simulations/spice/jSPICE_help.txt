After a successful compilation, you can run the simulation in one of 3 ways:

1) Macro mode
./Griffinv10 spice.mac
Execute a single macro file in bath mode.
The detailed comments in spice.mac explain the various functions

2) Visualisation mode
./Griffinv10
Open the GUI interface the run the following command in the "Session" box to open the SPICE visualisation
/control/execute SPICE_vis.mac
You may choose option in SPICE_vis.mac before running.
Also after running the script addition commands from the scrip may be run in the "Session" box e.g. 
/DetSys/gun/particle e-
/DetSys/gun/efficiencyEnergy 800 keV
/run/beamOn 2 ### Keep number low
You can disable parts of the geometry in the gui "Scene tree" for clearer viewing

3) Automated batch mode
bash AutoEffCurve.sh
To automatically generate an efficiency curve.
First edit AutoEffCurve.sh to select energy points, lens, target and event number.
Run 'bash AutoEffCurve.sh' to run geant4 and generate sequential root files,
then run 'root MakeEfficiency.c' in the same folder as the previous output
to generate and save the efficiency curve.
If you have jRootAnalysisTools installed you can instead run MakeEfficiencyjRoot.c,
which will use fits to provide more accurate results.

Multi layered targets may be added as described in spice.mac
These stack face to face from the beam position defined by /DetSys/gun/position
(at the time the target layer command is called)
Materials that are not defined within the MyMaterial framework within
DetectorConstructionSuppressed.cc will seg-fault the program.
You can use the visualiser to ensure the targets are positioned as expected

Histograms are produced for SPICE showing the:
Detected Energies
Emission angle of detected electrons (for kinematic work)
The emission position (to check the distribution settings, z is relative to /DetSys/gun/position)

Be careful to ensure field file matches with the geometry used to create the chamber.
These are two separate lines in all macros, that can be easily overlooked.

You may wish to distribute emission along the (z) beam axis according
to some non-uniform reaction distribution
Used "/Detsys/gun/FileDistro data.dat" where data.dat is any plain text file
containing white space delimited position and probability weight.
Position should be in um and relative to /DetSys/gun/position 
Weight does not need to be normalised.

Occasionally the program enters a geometric error loop. It will exit.
